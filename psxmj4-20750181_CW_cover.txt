RESOURCES USED:

When designing this system, all the design choices were made by me, with inspiration taking for existing design solutions. 

- https://w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp  **Formed the main tool for decision making around web page layout and professional design choices.

- https://wpdcan.com/css-login/  **This site provided inspiration for index.php, however, the design was mainly constructed around my own vision.
